3 Types of loops
[simple loops]
1 key have multiple values

- name: Simple user addition loop
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Create 5 users
      user:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items:
        - azam1
        - hassan1
        - faizi1
        - shahrukh1

- name: Simple loops with yum command
  hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Install 5 packages
      yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items:
        - httpd
        - vsftpd
        - wget
        - stress

This can also be done through making simple list with yum command. But it can be done through simple loops too.
because yum module supports lists at kernel/OS level. yum install httpd nfs, but useradd doesnot support adding multiple users in a single command, so we use loop for that.

                                2 or more keys have multiple values
