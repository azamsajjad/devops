You can use Amazon ElastiCache to support data-intensive apps or improve the performance of your existing apps by retrieving data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. This service offers fully managed Redis and Memcached cache engines for in-memory data stores. ElastiCache is a popular choice for gaming, advertising technology (ad tech), financial service, healthcare, and Internet of Things (IoT) apps.

On the surface, the Redis and Memcached engines look similar. Each is an in-memory key-value store. However, there are significant differences between the two. Requirements such as compliance, backup and replication, and automatic failover dictate which engine you should implement. For the full list of differences, see Comparing Memcached and Redis.

"There are three common types of data caches: built-in, application, and remote. A remote cache is a centralized, in-memory repository that can dramatically improve the responsiveness of databases and applications. It stores data externally from the database in a non-relational key-value database. ElastiCache is a remote cache engine and supports the two most common open source caching engines: Memcached and Redis.

SECURITY 
All new ElastiCache clusters are launched within an Amazon VPC. One of the unique benefits of ElastiCache is that on-premises servers can use it if they are connected to the AWS Cloud using a VPN or AWS Direct Connect.

ElastiCache for Memcached does not currently offer versions that are compliant with HIPAA, although ElastiCache for Redis does. ElastiCache uses IAM for user authentication and authorization. Optionally, ElastiCache for Redis can use Redis AUTH for authentication.

COST 
ElastiCache provides both On-Demand and Reserved Node types, and you are never charged for traffic in or out of the ElastiCache nodes themselves. You are instead charged for the Amazon EC2 data transfer rates per gigabyte per month.

Standard Amazon EC2 regional data transfer charges apply to both inbound and outbound data transfer between Regions. ElastiCache does not charge for the first database snapshot.

LAZY LOADING - WRITE THROUGH
Two common approaches to caching are lazy loading and write-through. Lazy loading is reactive. Data is put into the cache the first time it is requested. Write-through is proactive. Data is put into the cache at the same time it is put into the database."

With both ElastiCache for Redis and ElastiCache for Memcached, you:

No longer need to perform management tasks such as hardware provisioning, software patching, setup, configuration, and failure recovery
Have access to monitoring metrics, enabling you to diagnose and react to issues quickly
Can take advantage of cost-efficient and resizable hardware capacity


"Choose Memcached if the following apply for you:"
You need the simplest model possible.
You need to run large nodes with multiple cores or threads.
You need the ability to scale out and in, adding and removing nodes as demand on your system increases and decreases.
You need to cache objects.

"Choose Redis with a version of ElastiCache for Redis if the following apply for you:"
ElastiCache for Redis version 7.0 (Enhanced)----------------------
You want to use Redis Functions, Sharded Pub/Sub, or Redis ACL improvements.
ElastiCache for Redis version 6.2 (Enhanced)-----------------------
You want the ability to tier data between memory and SSD using the r6gd node type. 
ElastiCache for Redis version 6.0 (Enhanced)-----------------------
You want to authenticate users with role-based access control.

ElastiCache for Redis version 5.0.0 (Enhanced)--------------------
You want to use Redis streams, a log data structure that allows producers to append new items in real time and also allows consumers to consume messages either in a blocking or non-blocking fashion.

ElastiCache for Redis version 4.0.10 (Enhanced)--------------------
Supports both encryption and dynamically adding or removing shards from your Redis (cluster mode enabled) cluster.

"MemoryDB for Redis
In other hand, MemoryDB for Redis aims to replace both cache and database in one component – provides microsecond read latency and data durability.

Amazon ElastiCache for Redis & Memcached
Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a manged version of Redis – in-memory data store used mainly for caching. It can be placed in front of a database, like DynamoDB or RDS, to speed reads operations. Two common caching strategies are lazy loading and write-through."

ElastiCache is a fully managed, in-memory caching solution. It provides support for two open-source, in-memory cache engines: Redis and Memcached. You aren’t responsible for instance failovers, backups and restores, or software upgrades.
        USECASES
        Caching to ease the load off your relational or NoSQL database
        Session store
        Amazon ElastiCache can be used as a session store to manage session information for both Redis and Memcached. This session management is commonly required for online applications, including games, e-commerce websites and social media platforms.
        Machine learning (AI/ML) use E4R for fraud detection in fin,game
        machmaking, ride sharing
        Real-time analytics with kafka,kinesis, time series data analytics

[Elasticache 101 for Redis]
    in-memory cache
    improves database performance
    good for read-heavy database workloads
    2 types:
        Memcached - inmemory key-value data store
                    good for object caching
                    good for simple caching solution
                    no persistence or multi-AZ
        Redis - inmemory key-value data store
                persistence, replication, multi-az, failover
                supports sorting and ranking data 
                good for lists, hasshes, gaming boards
                millisecond read latency
                use case - website that needs to store session data

elasticache is good choice if database is read-heavy and not prone to frequent changing 
caching doesnot help if you are overloaded with write loads, then you need to scale up your database and if you are using OLAP, think redshift.

Amazon MemoryDB for Redis

MemoryDB is a Redis-compatible, durable, in-memory database service that delivers ultra-fast performance. With MemoryDB, you can achieve microsecond read latency, single-digit millisecond write latency, high throughput, and Multi-AZ durability for modern applications, like those built with microservices architectures. You can use MemoryDB as a fully managed, primary database to build high-performance applications. You do not need to separately manage a cache, durable database, or the required underlying infrastructure.

[MemoryDB 101 for Redis]
