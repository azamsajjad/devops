Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)


Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a set-and-forget file system that automatically grows and shrinks as you add and remove files. There is no need for provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance. Amazon EFS can be used with AWS compute services and on-premises resources. You can connect tens, hundreds, and even thousands of compute instances to an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, and Amazon EFS can provide consistent performance to each compute instance.

With the Amazon EFS simple web interface, you can create and configure file systems quickly without any minimum fee or setup cost. You pay only for the storage used and you can choose from a range of storage classes designed to fit your use case. 

Standard storage classes-----------
EFS Standard and EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) offer Multi-AZ resilience and the highest levels of durability and availability.

One zone storage classes------------
EFS One Zone and EFS One Zone-Infrequent Access (EFS One Zone-IA) provide additional savings by saving your data in a single availability zone.


@ Simple interface through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the Amazon EFS API.

@ File system access semantics, such as strong data consistency and file locking. You can use Amazon EFS to control access to your file systems through Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) permissions. 

@ Supports authentication, authorization, and encryption capabilities to help you meet your security and compliance requirements.

@ Provides the throughput, input/output operations per second (IOPS), and low latency needed for a broad range of workloads. With Amazon EFS, you can choose from two performance modes and two throughput modes:
---
The default General Purpose performance mode is ideal for latency-sensitive use cases, such as web serving environments, content management systems, home directories, and general file serving. File systems in the Max I/O mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and IOPS. The tradeoff is slightly higher latencies for file metadata operations.
---
Using the default Bursting Throughput mode, throughput scales as your file system grows. Using Provisioned Throughput mode, you can specify the throughput of your file system independent of the amount of data stored.
-----------------------------
Shared file systems with NFS v4.0 and v4.1 support
–
Amazon EFS provides secure access for thousands of connections for Amazon EC2 instances, AWS container and serverless compute services, and on-premises servers. The service uses a traditional file permissions model, file locking, and hierarchical directory structure using the NFSv4 protocol. Amazon EC2 instances can access your file system across Availability Zones and Regions. By contrast, on-premises servers can access file systems using AWS Direct Connect or AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN).
----------------------------
Containers and serverless file storage
–
Amazon EFS integrates with AWS containers and serverless compute services that require shared storage for latency-sensitive and IOPS-heavy workloads at any scale. 

Amazon EFS provides applications running on Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda, access to shared file systems for stateful workloads.
