You have found that Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC is resolving to a different IP address for the domain name corp.anycompany.org compared to servers that are on-premises and using public DNS resolvers. The EC2 instance is using the Route 53 resolver.


What could be the cause of this behavior?


The Route 53 resolver is malfunctioning - contact AWS Support.

The public hosted zone for corp.anycompany.org in Route 53 is using an incorrect NS record.

"The VPC is configured with a Route 53 Private Hosted zone that has a record for corp.anycompany.org."

The EC2 instance running the Route 53 resolver is misconfigured.


why

// The VPC is configured with a Route 53 Private Hosted zone that has a record for corp.anycompany.org.

// Private hosted zones in Route 53 are associated with a specific VPC. When a private hosted zone is created in a VPC, it provides a mechanism for resolving domain names within that VPC.

// If there is a private hosted zone for "corp.anycompany.org" within the VPC, the EC2 instance in that VPC would use this private hosted zone for DNS resolution. This might result in a different IP address being resolved compared to servers on-premises using public DNS resolvers.

// Here's why the other options are not the likely cause:

// The Route 53 resolver is malfunctioning - contact AWS Support: This is a less likely cause, as AWS services like Route 53 are highly reliable. It's more likely that the issue is related to the specific configuration of resources in the VPC.

// The public hosted zone for corp.anycompany.org in Route 53 is using an incorrect NS record: This could potentially cause resolution issues for external DNS servers, but it wouldn't impact the resolution within the VPC itself.

// The EC2 instance running the Route 53 resolver is misconfigured: This could be a possibility, but it's less likely compared to the presence of a private hosted zone in the VPC. A misconfiguration on the EC2 instance itself would affect all DNS resolutions, not just for specific domains.

// AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that uses static IP addresses (Anycast) to direct traffic over the AWS global network to optimal AWS endpoint locations. It takes into consideration factors like endpoint health, client locations, and user-configured weights to ensure that traffic is routed to the most suitable and healthy endpoints, improving the overall performance and availability of applications.

// CloudFront, IPSEC VPN, and DirectConnect are not designed for the same purpose:

// CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates the delivery of content to end-users. While it can improve performance, it doesn't offer the same level of control over routing and endpoint health as AWS Global Accelerator.

// IPSEC VPN is used to establish a secure connection between an on-premises network and AWS, but it doesn't provide the traffic optimization and routing capabilities of AWS Global Accelerator.

Amazon API Gateway

// AWS Global Accelerator is specifically designed to improve the availability and performance of applications by utilizing AWS's vast global network infrastructure. It routes traffic over the AWS global network to optimize the path from the client to the application endpoint, thus reducing latency and jitter.

// AWS Private Link is used for accessing services over a private connection within an AWS network, but it doesn't directly address global network performance.

// AWS Transit Gateway is a service for routing traffic between VPCs and VPN connections, but it doesn't specifically focus on optimizing global network performance.

As a network engineer you are designing a Web load-balancing solution in AWS. The internal users will be visiting Web site from remote offices using the public Internet. The users traffic must be encrypted end-to-end from their devices into AWS backend servers.

Which of the following provides an architecture that meets the design requirements?


Use Application Load Balancer with HTTP enabled on the user device and backend servers.

'Use Use Application Load Balancer (ALB) and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to deploy a certificate on the ALB with HTTPS listeners. Perform end-to-end Transport layer security (TLS) encryption.'

Use Network Load Balancer with HTTP enable on the user device and backend servers.

Use Network Load Balancer (NLB) and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to deploy a certificate on the NLB with HTTPS listeners.



Explanation:

// Application Load Balancer (ALB): ALB is designed for routing traffic at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS) and is suitable for web applications. It supports SSL/TLS termination, which allows you to encrypt traffic between the user and the ALB.

// AWS Certificate Manager (ACM): ACM provides SSL/TLS certificates for secure connections. You can use ACM to deploy a certificate on the ALB, enabling HTTPS for end-to-end encryption.

// Perform end-to-end Transport layer security (TLS) encryption: This means that the connection is encrypted from the user's device all the way to the backend servers. The ALB will terminate the SSL/TLS connection at the ALB, but it will establish a new encrypted connection to the backend servers.

// The other options involve using HTTP, which doesn't provide the necessary encryption for securing the connection. Additionally, Network Load Balancer (NLB) operates at the transport layer (TCP/UDP) and doesn't support SSL/TLS termination, so it doesn't align with the requirement for end-to-end encryption.

An organization configured EC2 instances serving web traffic for an application behind the Amazon Application Load Balancer(ALB). Each of the EC2's Availability Zone configurations align with the ALB's Availability zones, and it was observed that a single Amazon EC2 instance is getting overloaded, and traffic imbalance happens frequently. The ALB uses round robin routing algorithm to send requests to the target servers, assuming no issues on ALB and EC2 service.

What could be the potential cause of such behavior?


ALB uses content-based routing.

It is an expected ALB behavior.

ALB to backend connection uses HTTPS that will make a single EC2 server do more task.

'Application Load balancer target group has ALB generated cookie setting enabled'

// Explanation:

// When the Application Load Balancer (ALB) has the "stickiness" feature enabled (achieved through ALB-generated cookies), it causes the ALB to consistently route requests from a specific client to the same EC2 instance. This can lead to an overload on that particular EC2 instance, especially if there is a high volume of traffic from the same client.

// The ALB-generated cookie feature allows the ALB to bind a user's session to a specific instance. If a user's session is tied to an overloaded instance, it may result in traffic imbalance.

// The other options are not the cause of the observed behavior:

// ALB uses content-based routing: Content-based routing does not inherently cause traffic imbalance or overload on a specific instance.

// It is an expected ALB behavior: While some level of traffic distribution variation is expected due to the nature of the round-robin algorithm, significant overload on a single instance is not expected.

// ALB to backend connection uses HTTPS that will make a single EC2 server do more task: While HTTPS may introduce some additional processing overhead, it should not lead to significant overload on a single instance unless the traffic volume is extremely high.

// The most likely cause of the behavior described is the ALB-generated cookie setting, which can lead to sessions being bound to a specific instance, potentially causing an imbalance in traffic distribution.

You are responsible for deploying a fleet of 40 Amazon EC2 servers in a new subnet within an existing Amazon VPC. These servers will not require DNS resolution. The network 10.0.0.64/26 has been selected for the subnet.

What is the range of IP addresses available for instances in the subnet?


'10.0.0.68 - 10.0.0.126'

10.0.0.67 - 10.0.0.125

10.0.0.64 - 10.0.0.127

10.0.0.65 - 10.0.0.126



// 0.0: Network address.
// 0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.
// 0.2: Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is the base of the VPC network range plus two. ...
// 0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.
// 0.255: Network broadcast address.

You are a network engineer for AnyCompany and have received feedback that users are experiencing heavy latency when accessing data, videos, and applications hosted in your VPC.

Which edge networking services would you implement to provide lower latency and higher transfer speeds?


AWS Site-to-Site VPN

AWS PrivateLink

AWS Global Accelerator

Amazon CloudFront


'Amazon CloudFront'

// Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that caches content in multiple edge locations worldwide. By distributing content closer to the end-users, CloudFront reduces latency and improves transfer speeds.

// The other services listed have different purposes:

// AWS Site-to-Site VPN is used to establish secure connections between on-premises networks and AWS, but it doesn't specifically address latency or transfer speeds.

// AWS PrivateLink allows you to access services over a private connection within an AWS network, but it's not focused on improving latency or transfer speeds.

// AWS Global Accelerator is designed to improve the availability and performance of applications by utilizing AWS's vast global network infrastructure. While it can help with performance, it's not specifically designed for content caching and acceleration like CloudFront.

Anycompany has a security policy that data should not traverse the public internet even when encrypted. They want to utilize Amazon S3 service and have set up buckets in AWS regions us-east-2 and us-west-1. The primary data center's closest AWS region is us-west-1. The application is sensitive to latency and the cost is an essential factor.

Which design will achieve Anycompany's requirements?


AWS Direct Connect connection to us-west-1 and a VPN connection to us-east-2

AWS Direct Connect connection to us-east-2 and a second Direct Connect connection to us-west-1

Establish a VPN connection from the Data Center to us-east-2 and us-west-1 AWS regions.
