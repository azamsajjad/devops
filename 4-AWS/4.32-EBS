The AWS block storage portfolio consists of two types of block storage services: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance storage and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS). Amazon EBS also includes an integrated snapshot service. Amazon EBS is the primary block storage service. 

Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP also offers block storage services over an iSCSI access protocol. These block services use NetApp's application programming interface (API) calls and management interface. For customer's seeking an integrated NetApp approach, block storage is available as part of the Amazon FSx service.'

INSTANCE STORE
Instance store is ideal for the following use cases:

Temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content
Data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers
Instances stores are not recommended for most block storage workloads.

As ephemeral storage, instance stores are not replicated or spread across multiple devices to improve durability and availability. An instance store is nonpersistent and is terminated when the associated EC2 instance is terminated.

data in the instance store is lost under any of the following circumstances:

The underlying disk drive fails

The instance stops

The instance hibernates

The instance terminates

Therefore, do not rely on an instance store for valuable, long-term data. Instead, use more durable data storage, such as Amazon EBS, for your block storage requirements.

Also, you can use EBS snapshots with automated lifecycle policies to back up your volumes in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). You can do this  while ensuring geographic protection of your data and business continuity.

With Amazon EBS, you pay only for the storage and resources that you provision.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

EBS SNAPSHOTS
point in time copy of EBS Volume
if you create new EBS volume from an encrypted snapshot, you will get an encrypted volume - same for unencrypted 
Create a snapshot of the EC2 volume. Then create a copy of the snapshot, checking the box to enable encryption. Create an AMI of the copied snapshot and then redeploy the EC2 instance using the encrypted AMI. Delete the old EC2 instance.


===========================================================================
As the name implies, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is block-level storage that you can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance. You can compare this to how you much attach an external drive to your laptop. This attachable storage is called an EBS volume. EBS volumes act similarly to external drives in more than one way.


bullet
Detachable: You can detach an EBS volume from one EC2 instance and attach it to another EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone to access the data on it.


bullet
Distinct: The external drive is separate from the computer. That means that if an accident occurs and the computer goes down, you still have your data on your external drive. The same is true for EBS volumes.


bullet
Size-limited: You’re limited to the size of the external drive, because it has a fixed limit to how scalable it can be. For example, you might have a 2 TB external drive, which means you can only have 2 TB of content on it. This also relates to Amazon EBS, because a volume also has a max limitation of how much content you can store on it.


bullet
1-to-1 connection: Most EBS volumes can only be connected with one computer at a time. Most EBS volumes have a one-to-one relationship with EC2 instances, so they cannot be shared by or attached to multiple instances at one time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS announced the Amazon EBS multi-attach feature that permits Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) volumes to be attached to multiple EC2 instances at one time. This feature is not available for all instance types, and all instances must be in the same Availability Zone.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Increase the volume size only if it doesn’t increase above the maximum size limit. Depending on the volume selected, Amazon EBS currently supports a maximum volume size of 64 tebibytes (TiB). For example, if you provision a 5-TiB io2 Block Express volume, you can choose to increase the size of your volume until you get to 64 TiB.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Attach multiple volumes to a single EC2 instance. Amazon EC2 has a one-to-many relationship with EBS volumes. You can add these additional volumes during or after EC2 instance creation to provide more storage capacity for your hosts.

Amazon EBS use cases

Amazon EBS is useful when you must retrieve data quickly and have data persist long term. Volumes are commonly used in the following scenarios.

To learn more, expand each of the following four categories.


Operating systems
–
Boot and root volumes can be used to store an operating system. The root device for an instance launched from an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is typically an EBS volume. These are commonly referred to as EBS-backed AMIs.


Databases
–
As a storage layer for databases running on Amazon EC2 that will scale with your performance needs and provide consistent and low-latency performance.


Enterprise applications
–
Amazon EBS provides high availability and high durability block storage to run business-critical applications.


Big data analytics engines
–
Amazon EBS offers data persistence, dynamic performance adjustments, and the ability to detach and reattach volumes, so you can resize clusters for big data analytics.


==========================================================================
SNAPSHOTS .
EBS snapshots are incremental backups that only save the blocks on the volume that have changed after your most recent snapshot. For example, if you have 10 GB of data on a volume and only 2 GB of data have been modified since your last snapshot, only the 2 GB that have been changed are written to Amazon S3.






EBS FEATURES.
Single Availability Zone
–
You create an EBS volume in a specific Availability Zone, and then attach it to an EC2 instance in that same Availability Zone. The proximity of your Amazon EBS volume to your Amazon EC2 instance provides low latency and high-performance block storage for your workload.



To make a volume available outside of the Availability Zone, you can create a snapshot and restore that snapshot to a new volume anywhere in the same AWS Region. You can also copy snapshots to other AWS Regions and then restore them to new volumes there. Snapshots make it easier to use multiple AWS Regions for geographical expansion, data center migration, and disaster recovery.

High availability and high durability
–
EBS volumes are designed to be highly available, reliable, and durable at no additional charge to you. EBS volume data is replicated across multiple servers in an Availability Zone to prevent the loss of data from the failure of any single component. 



Amazon EBS volumes are designed to provide 99.8–99.9 percent durability with an annual failure rate (AFR) of 0.1–0.2 percent. Amazon EBS also supports a snapshot feature, which is a good way to take point-in-time backups of your data. 



Amazon EBS offers a higher durability io2 volume that is designed to provide 99.999 percent durability with an AFR of 0.001 percent. In this case, failure refers to a complete or partial loss of the volume. This makes io2 ideal for business-critical applications, such as SAP HANA, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and IBM DB2, that will benefit from higher uptime. 


Data encryption
–
You can create your EBS volumes as encrypted volumes to meet a wide range of data-at-rest encryption requirements for regulated/audited data and applications. When you create an encrypted EBS volume and attach it to a supported instance type, data stored at rest on the volume, disk I/O, and snapshots that were created from the volume are all encrypted. The encryption occurs on the servers that host EC2 instances, providing encryption of data in transit from EC2 instances to Amazon EBS storage.


Native snapshot support

AWS Backup support
–
AWS Backup supports backing up your EBS volumes. With AWS Backup, you can centralize and automate data protection across multiple Amazon EBS volumes. AWS Backup offers a cost-effective, fully managed, policy-based service that further simplifies data protection at scale. 



AWS Backup also helps you support your regulatory compliance obligations and meet your business continuity goals.


Performance monitoring
–
Performance metrics, such as bandwidth, throughput, latency, and average queue length, are available through the AWS Management Console. Amazon CloudWatch provides these metrics so that you can monitor the performance of your volumes. You can make sure that you are providing enough performance for your applications and paying only for resources you need.
