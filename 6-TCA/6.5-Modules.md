5	Interact with Terraform modules
5a	Contrast and use different module source options including the public Terraform Module Registry
5b	Interact with module inputs and outputs
5c	Describe variable scope within modules/child modules

# MODULES

## TERRAFORM PROJECTS = MODULES
workdir = Root Module

## registry.terraform.io Pre-built Modules

## Create child Module = Reusable block of infra code

see 4-ec2aws
Terraform Modules can be publicly found in the Terraform Registry
when you search for a module, only official modules come back as results
terraform init command will download and cache any modules referenced by a configuration
> Public Modules  - registry
Terraform Registry is integrated directly into Terraform
The syntax for specifying a registry module is
<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>

> Private Modules - terraform cloud
Private registry modules have source strings of the form
<HOSTNAME>/<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>
To configure private module access, you need to authenticate against Terraform Cloud via terraform login
Alternatively you can create a user API Token and manually configure credentials in the CLI config file.


## Publishing Modules
Public modules are managed via a public Git repo on GitHub
Once a module is registered, to push updates
you simply push new versions to properly
formed Git Tags
You can connect your github to terraform and publish your module in seconds.
Published modules support:

Versioning
automatically generate documentation
allow browsing version histories
show examples
READMEs

Repos names must be in the following format:
terraform-<PROVIDER>-<NAME>

## Verified Modules
Verified modules are reviewed by HashiCorp and actively maintained by contributors to stay up-to-date and compatible with both Terraform and their respective providers.
The verified badge appears next to the module

Verified modules are expected to be actively maintained by HashiCorp partners
verified badge isn't indicative of flexibility or feature support
• very simple modules can be verified just because they're great examples of modules
• unverified module could be extremely high quality and actively maintained
• unverified module shouldn't be assumed to be poor quality
Unverified means it hasn't been created by a HashiCorp partner

## Module Structure
The primary entry point is the Root Module.
These are required files in the root directory:
|root
|__ Main.tf - the entry point file of your module
|__ Variables.tf — variable that can be passed in
|__ Outputs.tf — Outputed values
|__ README — Describes how the module works
|__ LICENSE — The license under which this module is available
|__ subModule/
    |__ Main.tf - the entry point file of your module
    |__ Variables.tf — variable that can be passed in
    |__ Outputs.tf — Outputed values
    |__ README — Describes how the module works
    |__ LICENSE — The license under which this module is available
same structure for nested modules
Nested modules are optional must be contained in the
modules/ directory:
A submodule that contains a README is consider usable
by external users
A submodule that does not contain a README is consider
internal use only
Avoid using relative paths when sourcing module blocks.

> terraform Modules
A Terrform module is a group of configuration files that provide common configuration functionality.
• Enforces best practices
• reduce the amount of code
• Reduce time to develop scripts
- AWS Provider (not a module)
If you had to create a VPC you would have
specific many networking resources.
- AWS VPC Module
Using a module you can use a a shorthand Domain Specific Language (DSL)
That will reduce the amount of work.
