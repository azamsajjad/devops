# Debugging Terraform
Terraform has detailed logs which can be enabled
by setting the TF_LOG environment variable to:
TRACE
DEBUG
INFO
WARN
ERROR
JSON — outputs logs at the TRACE level
or higher, and uses a parseable JSON
encoding as the formatting.


Logging can be enabled separately:
• TF_LOG_CORE
• TF_LOG_PROVIDER
takes the same options as TF_LOG
Choose where you want to log with

If Terraform ever crashes (a "panic" in the Go runtime), it saves a log file with the debug logs from the session as well as the panic message and backtrace to crash.log
