4-Configure local storage
List, create, delete partitions on MBR and GPT disks
Create and remove physical volumes
Assign physical volumes to volume groups
Create and delete logical volumes
Configure systems to mount file systems at boot by universally unique ID (UUID) or label
Add new partitions and logical volumes, and swap to a system non-destructively

du -sh /root combine size
du -ah /root file sizes
check directory size on disk
create a swap partition
df -h /
df -h /mnt
blkid (get uuID)
lsblk -l & -f
fdisk -l
fdisk 
t - to change partition type - select 82
partprobe
mkswap -L more_swap /dev/sda7 (label=more_swap)
swapon /dev/sda7
swapon
edit /etc/fstab
umount then mount -a (this way we will know its persistent)
free -h (view Ram)

Formatting Disk Partition with FAT32 File System
1. To format a disk with a FAT32 file system, use:
sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdb1 upto 4gb
wipefs -a /dev/sda7 to refresh df -h
resize2fs /dev/sda7 to refresh df -h
mkfs -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 upto 1kb
ext4 16gb-16tb journaling filesystem to prevent data loss
ext4 support signle filesize of 16gb
ext4 is default in debian/ubuntu
ext4 you can reduce the size of ext4
ext4 is most compatible across linux,mac,windows
ext4 is better for single r/w thread
XFS is optimized for large file transfers and parrallel I/O operations
XFS supports larger file sizes & volumes
XFS uses more advanced journaling system
XFS is better for multiple read/write threads
XFS is default on RHEL
XFS supports growing but not reducing size of partition
XFS features built-in backup and recovery tools

CREATE a LOGICAL VOLUME
pvcreate /dev/sda7
pvs
vgcreate newVG /dev/sda7
vgs
lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n newLVM newVG
lvs
vdostats --hu
lsblk
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/newVG-newLVM
mkdir /dir
vim /etc/fstab
/dev/mapper/newVG-newLVM    /dir    ext4 defaults 0 0
mount -a
mount | grep dir
ADD 1GB storage to dir
pvcreate /dev/sda8
vgextend newVG /dev/sda8
lvextend -L +1G newVG/newLVM
lvs
df -h /dir -> still 2gb
resize2fs /dev/mapper/newVG/newLVM

to REMOVE
umount /dir
lvremove newLVM
vgremove -f newVG
pvremove /dev/sda7 /dev/sda8
wipefs -a /dev/sda7 /dev/sda8
